# CNN Creator
CNN Creator provides a graphical interface to prototype/develop CNN's. It is currently in early stages but has decent support for creation of custom CNN architecture as well as importing and exporting Caffe models (using the network prototxt).

## Quick Setup
After cloning the repo, run

```
npm install
```

Now, navigate to `localhost:8888` in a browser and create a new project. Select `CNN` as the seed and start creating your neural nets!

There are examples in the `Examples` directory.
